=When running sma_get as a daemon:=
<br>
The client is communicating to the sever by shared memory, actually an IPC-socket, so both should run as the same user.<br>
<br>
When starting daemon mode always give the highest device_nr in the command, otherwise it only communicates with the first inverter.<br>
example if using 4 SMA inverters: sma_get -D -n3<br>
<br>
A client process, such as "sma_get -d", always looks if a daemon is running, if not, it will communicate directly to the SMA device.<br>
<br>
The daemon will shutdown when communication to one of the inverters is interrupted.<br>
This is because the initialization to all invertes should be done again, after one is comming back online again.<br>
