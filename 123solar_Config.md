# Configuration of 123Solar #
See below an example of a in 123Solar configured SMA device.<br>
SMA's don't have separate values if you connect 2 array's.<br>
so see the underlined entry's, also set the power of array2 to 0<br>
Daemon mode is quicker, if in debug mode, the logfile find in the error directory of the highest SMA inverter.<br>
